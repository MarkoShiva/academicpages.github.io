I am Software Developer with experience in development and support of various software and technologies.
For a long time I am supporter of [Free Software Foundation](https://www.fsf.org/) and its movement as well as [Open Source](https://opensource.org/) movement and as well I have been Linux user 
for over 20 years now.


In the past I used to work also Linux System Engineering jobs and DevOps jobs. 
My current interests related to computer science include:

  * web development in python mostly 
  * AI/ML development and research related stuff mostly [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)
  * GUI development based on [Qt Framework](https://www.qt.io/) mostly C++ or Python with [PySide2](https://www.qt.io/qt-for-python)
  * various types of application development in languages and frameworks that I know
  * Mobile development - current interests include [Plasma Mobile](https://www.plasma-mobile.org/) and Android development 
        with focus on learning Kotlin
  * Game Development - For now Unity based with C# although I might give a try to Unreal Engine and C++
